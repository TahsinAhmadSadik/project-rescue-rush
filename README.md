Each person faces unique challenges, and every mission requires solving distinct, thoughtful puzzles to bring them to safety.

**To dear developers:**  
This repository contains the code of the laptop version. If you want to download the codes and play it on pc, please change the variable `ratio` to `1` (can be found at the beginning of the file) in <ins>"iMain.cpp"</ins>. This hassle is here only because laptops have a default display zoom that changes the screen ratio. If you want to come back to the laptop version, set `ratio` to `0.8`. If your display zoom is anything else, set `ratio` to `1/display_zoom` to get the full experience.
